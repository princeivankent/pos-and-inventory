# Brand Voice Guidelines

## Core Principles

### 1. Casual and Direct
Write like you're explaining to a friend over coffee, not pitching to investors.

**Good:**
- "This saves you 2 hours every day"
- "You know that annoying thing where...?"
- "Here's what I built"

**Bad:**
- "Leveraging cutting-edge technology to optimize workflows"
- "Synergistic solutions for modern enterprises"
- "Revolutionizing the industry"

### 2. No Corporate Buzzwords
Avoid marketing jargon and empty phrases.

**Banned words/phrases:**
- Leverage, synergy, revolutionize, disrupt
- Game-changing, cutting-edge, next-generation
- Empower, unlock potential, transform
- Seamless, robust, scalable (unless explaining tech specifically)
- Solutions, platform, ecosystem (use specific terms instead)

**Instead, use:**
- Specific verbs: "saves," "cuts," "fixes," "tracks"
- Real outcomes: "2 hours faster," "zero errors," "works offline"
- Simple nouns: "app," "tool," "system" (when needed)

### 3. Focus on Real Benefits
Show concrete results, not vague promises.

**Good:**
- "Close 90 minutes earlier every night"
- "Cuts inventory errors to zero"
- "Works without internet"

**Bad:**
- "Streamline your operations"
- "Enhance productivity"
- "Drive business growth"

### 4. Simple Language
Use words everyone understands. Avoid jargon unless it's industry-specific and necessary.

**Good:**
- "It works on your phone and tablet"
- "Updates happen instantly"
- "See what's selling"

**Bad:**
- "Multi-platform responsive interface"
- "Real-time data synchronization across devices"
- "Advanced analytics dashboard"

## Tone Examples

### Feature Description
**Good:**
> Scan items with your phone. It updates your inventory instantly. No more manual counts.

**Bad:**
> Our innovative barcode scanning solution leverages mobile-first technology to seamlessly synchronize inventory data in real-time.

### Problem Statement
**Good:**
> You update stock on one device, but it doesn't show up on the others. Sales get confusing.

**Bad:**
> Fragmented data across multiple touchpoints creates operational inefficiencies and revenue leakage.

### Benefit/Outcome
**Good:**
> Know exactly what you need to reorder, the moment you need to know it.

**Bad:**
> Gain unprecedented visibility into supply chain dynamics with actionable intelligence.

## Writing Checklist

Before publishing any marketing content, verify:

- [ ] Would I say this to a friend? (If no, rewrite)
- [ ] Does it explain the REAL benefit? (Not just what it does, but what that unlocks)
- [ ] Zero buzzwords? (Scan for banned phrases)
- [ ] Specific numbers/outcomes? (Not vague improvement claims)
- [ ] Simple words only? (Could a teenager understand it?)
- [ ] Does it sound human? (Not like a press release)
