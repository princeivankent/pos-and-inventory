## Tweet Thread

Structure: Hook → Credibility → Value → CTA

### Hook (Tweet 1)
Start with a problem or result that stops the scroll:
- "I wasted 3 hours doing X until I found this..."
- "Here's why your [thing] isn't working..."
- "I built [result] in [timeframe]. Here's how:"

### Build Credibility (Tweet 2)
Show you understand the problem:
- Share the old painful way
- Show you've been there
- Acknowledge what doesn't work

### Show Value (Tweets 3-5)
Break down the solution:
- One key point per tweet
- Use specifics, not vague benefits
- Make it scannable (numbers, bullets, short lines)

### CTA (Final Tweet)
End with a clear next step:
- Try it: [link]
- Want more? Reply and I'll send you [thing]
- Built something cool with this? Show me

**Example:**
```
1/5 I spent 6 hours every week manually counting inventory.
Then I built something that does it in 30 seconds.

2/5 The old way: spreadsheets, manual counts, constant mistakes.
You know the drill. Close early, recount, still find errors the next day.

3/5 Now: scan barcodes with your phone, it updates everywhere instantly.
Your POS knows what's in stock. Your kitchen knows what to prep.

4/5 Best part? It works offline. Internet goes down? Keep selling.
Everything syncs when you're back online.

5/5 Try it free: [link]
Built for small businesses who don't have time for complicated software.

Subject: Stop wasting time on inventory counts

Hey,

If you run a small restaurant or cafe, you know the drill: closing time means counting everything. Again.

It's boring. It's error-prone. And it takes forever.

I built a simple POS system that handles inventory in real-time. You scan items as you sell them, and it automatically updates your stock. No spreadsheets. No manual counts at closing.

You'll know exactly what you have, what you need to order, and what's selling. All from your phone or tablet.
